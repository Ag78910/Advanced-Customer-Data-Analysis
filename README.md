# Advanced Customer Data Analysis

This project performs an in-depth analysis of customer data to uncover insights into purchasing behavior, customer segmentation, and lifetime value. The analysis is done using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Contents

- `Advanced_Customer_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: The main analysis notebook.
- `dataset_AW.csv`: The anonymized customer dataset used in the analysis.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) computation
- RFM Segmentation
- Cohort Analysis
- Data visualization using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`

## Requirements

To run this notebook, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. **Download the following files from the GitHub repository**:
   - `Advanced_Customer_Data_Analysis.ipynb`
   - `dataset_AW.csv`
   - `requirements.txt`

2. ðŸ“¥ **To download the CSV file**:
   - Go to the file `dataset_AW.csv` in the repository (left panel)
   - Click on the file to preview it
   - Then click the **"Download raw file"** button (top right) to save it to your computer

3. ðŸŸ¨ **Recommended environment**: This notebook is designed to run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - You can open it there and run all cells smoothly.

4. ðŸ“‚ **When running the notebook in Google Colab**:
   - Locate the cell titled `# Upload CSV file manually (for Google Colab)`
